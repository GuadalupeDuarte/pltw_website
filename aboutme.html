        <p><font size="5" "font-family:Arial" Hi I am Guadalupe, I am 15 years old. I was borm on January28,2002. </p>
        <p>I was born in Los Angeles, I live with my mom and dad. I moved to Bakersfiled when I was two years old with my parents and older sister, and ever since then I have lived here.</p>
        <p>In my family there is my mom Guadalupe, my dad Samuel, my sister Veronica, and my dogs</p>
        <p>Growing up, I lived in a house that had two other houses attached so in total there was three houses they were all seperated. I don't really know how to explain it. In the house that my grandparents own, my grandparents, my tia, her husband and her four kids.</p>
        <p>Then of course my parents, my older sister and I lived there. Growing up with them, I made some memorable memories, and til this day my tia that is also my godmother her family, my grandparents, and my family are close. Eventhough we live in sperate houses now. </p>
        <p>We moved out of the house in the summer of 7 grade going into 8. Ever since then I have lived in the house that I live in today.</p>
        <p>My favorite color has always been blue.</p>
        <p>When I graduate from high school I hope to study in the cosmetology field. I have had my mindset on this for a couple of years now and that's what I want to do.</p>
        <p>I also want to start my own bussiness. When I start my bussiness I want it to be hair and make-up, maybe through the years I'll add more, but for the start I just want it simple.</p>

            <p>Growing up I leaned many things from my family. One of the things I learned was English. At the age of 4 or 5, my cousins and sister though it was a good idea to teach me English.</p>
            <p>It was a good idea beacuse I had an understanding of what the language. Although I wasn't good at speacking English I gave it my all. I was put into ELD, and in a few years I got myself out of it. </p>
            <p>Some things that I have done over the past years are, I have been to 4 concert. My first concert was Selena Gomez, and I saw her in cocert last year as well.</p>
            <p>The people that I have been to see are Demi Lovato, Fifth Harmony, and Selena Gomez. I have been able to see these people thanks to my sister Veronica.</p>
            <p>I have aslo visited many places like Disneyland, Universal Studios, also Universal Studios Horror Nights.</p>
            <p>Another place that I have visited is Santa Monica.</p>
